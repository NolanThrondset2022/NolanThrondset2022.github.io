		<h1>About me</h1>
		<p>I usually spend my time playing videogames and am currently going through elden ring.
			I love to read and am currently rereading most of my comic collection I've collected since I was 10.
			Lately I've been trying to get back into lifting weights after the winter depression has left and allowed me to have more motivation.
			Right now we have 3 cats, Their names are Carter, Yuki, and Quincy.
			I often enjoy rain so much I will go out into the backyard while it's raining in order to experience it more.</p>

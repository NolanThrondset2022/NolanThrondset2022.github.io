	<h1 class="HEADER">Dream vacation</h1>
	<p id="dreamsP">My dream vacation would be to Japan with my mom for 2 weeks. During that trip it would be fun to both visit the urban side of japan in Tokyo and Kyoto but also more rural aspects like visiting different landmarks or just seeing the sites for nature, maybe trying out a hotsprings bath</p>
